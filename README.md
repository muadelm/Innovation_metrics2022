# Innovation_metrics2022

Variables

* GDP per capita
* GNI
* Global innovation index 
* emissions per capita 


Target: we need to understand the dataset

Then develop  a model to predict the innovation index using the other indicators. we can use regression model or decision tree model


We need to utilize the measured indicators to predict the innovation index. 

The value of the work is to investigate the relationship with the indicators, then try to generalize a relationship.
